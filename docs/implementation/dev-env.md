# Development environment — temporary

Delete this file when `self-hosting.md` and `development.md` exist and describe commands that actually work. See [the deletion protocol](README.md#deletion-protocol).

The service runs customer code in Firecracker microVMs, which needs Linux with KVM. Most of the codebase does not. This file is about which half you are working on, and where each half runs.

Start with the [read-only local doctor](../local-development.md) to diagnose
prerequisites without installing tools or starting dependencies. Current work uses
available local hardware; no paid infrastructure or deployment is required.

## Stage 0 — everything except a real VM, on macOS

The Rust libraries and local dependencies run natively today. The [HTTPS API binary and offline project provisioning](../api-server.md) now run locally; the [Rust client and project CLI](../client-cli.md) cover implemented Project operations; the [create/destroy controller](../controller.md) now runs against one operator-provisioned host. [The authenticated fake supervisor](../supervisor-protocol.md) now runs on loopback with operator-supplied certificates. Install `protoc` before building (`brew install protobuf` on macOS).

```text
macOS
├── sandbox-api          HTTP, auth, admission
├── sandbox-controller   claims, placement, dispatch
├── sandbox-fake-host    answers the supervisor's gRPC interface from memory
└── docker compose       PostgreSQL 16, MinIO
```

```sh
make api-setup # isolated pinned OpenAPI validators (once)
make sdk-setup # Python 3.11+, Node 24.9.0+ client tools (once)
make up      # PostgreSQL and MinIO, waits for both to be healthy
make check   # fmt, clippy, tests, documentation checks
make down    # stop, keeping data
```

`.env.example` holds the connection strings; copy it to `.env`. Those credentials are for the local stack only.

MinIO and its `mc` client are built from [verified official sources](../../dev/object-storage/README.md)
using the same immutable recipe as CI. The first `make up` builds the fixture;
it preserves existing development volumes. The object-storage ports bind to
loopback. No registry credentials or downloaded upstream binaries are needed.

The default Compose project is now `hudsonbox-dev`. Existing projects and volumes
keep their original names. To keep using an existing stack after the rename, set
`COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` to its current project name before running `make up` or
`make down`; `docker compose ls` lists existing projects. The repository rename
does not migrate, rename or remove dependency data or Lima instances.

The stack binds PostgreSQL on 55432 and MinIO on 59000, not their defaults. If you already run PostgreSQL natively, the container binds `::` while `127.0.0.1` stays with your own server, and every connection from the host quietly reaches the wrong database — which surfaces as a missing role rather than a port conflict. Non-default ports remove the ambiguity. `make reset-db` drops the development schema when a migration changes underneath you.

Authentication, admission, claims, reservations, and read handlers have executable tests. The fake provides the shared gRPC create/inspect/stop service over mTLS and always reports simulated evidence. It starts no VM or process. Create, execute and destroy are integrated through the controller, with real execution evidence from the [Linux supervisor](../real-supervisor.md). Retained output is archived and retrievable through the authenticated API. Public cancellation, files and live streaming are integrated. The [Rust client and project CLI](../client-cli.md) use generated [OpenAPI models and requests](../openapi.md). [Python/TypeScript clients](../language-clients.md) cover the same operations with shared conformance; distribution remains unfinished.

The fake models bounded resource accounting, stale ownership, lease expiry, duplicate requests, and lost acknowledgements for control-plane tests. Those models do not test host resource enforcement or hardware isolation; those require stage 1 and supported hardware.

## Stage 1 — real Firecracker on a nested Linux host

A dedicated aarch64 Linux/KVM host and a real Firecracker/jailer boot have now been verified on an M4 Pro. The [Linux development guide](../linux-development.md) owns the pinned Lima configuration, setup commands, observed process/cgroup evidence, and the limits of that experiment.

The guest runner, real supervisor and API/controller paths now execute commands, transfer files, stream output and reconcile destruction in this environment. The linked component contracts and evidence describe the tested boundaries. This setup keeps the Mac filesystem unmounted. It does not validate the supported x86_64 host, hostile workload isolation, or production performance. Keep those release gates separate from the aarch64 development evidence.

## Stage 2 — supported x86_64 hardware, when available

Needed for supported x86_64 compatibility and hostile-workload acceptance,
trustworthy performance measurements, later cross-host restore and privileged VM
CI. Use already-owned or otherwise available compatible hardware without paid
infrastructure. If none is available, keep this release gate unverified; renting
hardware is not required to continue local development. The [spike sheet](phase-0-spikes.md)
records the remaining questions. Existing development evidence does not transfer
automatically to this configuration.

Not blocking stages 0 and 1. It is [still listed as blocking](../roadmap.md#still-blocking) because the phase gates cannot pass without it.

## Build the images for both architectures from the start

You will be on aarch64 locally and x86_64 in production for a long time. Parameterize the guest kernel build and the rootfs build by architecture in the first version of those scripts. Hardcoding one and adding the other later turns every image change into two manual jobs, and the two drift.

## What runs where

| Component | macOS | Lima VM | Supported x86_64 host |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sandbox-protocol`, `sandbox-store`, `sandbox-client` | yes | yes | yes |
| `sandbox-api`, `sandbox-controller`, `sandbox-cli` | yes | yes | yes |
| `sandbox-fake-host` | yes | yes | yes |
| `sandbox-supervisor` | no — Linux only | yes | yes |
| `sandbox-guest` | no — Linux only | yes, inside the microVM | yes |
| PostgreSQL, MinIO | yes, via compose | yes | yes |
| Trustworthy measurements | no | no | yes |

## Opt-in history retirement

The controller's `--retire-history` worker can reclaim command/file reservations after consumer cleanup and either authenticated live guest/host acknowledgement or independently verified allocation destruction. Destruction claims preserve original ownership across host epoch changes. Configure [history retirement prerequisites](../history-reclamation.md#operator-activation) first. Ordinary development runs keep this disabled. The fake host does not provide durable retirement proof. Controlled nested-aarch64 evidence is distinct from supported-host release acceptance.

For registered physical hosts, add `--retire-allocations` to run [whole-allocation reclamation](../allocation-retirement.md#automatic-controller-worker) after domain and consumer closure. This flag requires `--retire-history` and cannot be combined with simulation. To run the controlled periodic-CLI integration case, build `cargo build -p sandbox-controller --bin sandbox-controller` in the same Linux checkout first; the host test launches that sibling binary. Use a separate Cargo target directory per worktree when validating different migration sets, so a cached embedded migrator from another checkout cannot contaminate the result.
