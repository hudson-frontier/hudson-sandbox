# Authenticated guest protocol

Status: the guest listener and supervisor client perform real command, receipt and output calls over Firecracker vsock. [Recorded aarch64 evidence](evidence/2026-09-21-aarch64-vsock.json) covers that boundary. The [allocation guardian](allocation-guardian.md) now provides independent host expiry and [guest bootstrap/binding](guest-bootstrap.md). The [real lifecycle RPC driver](real-supervisor.md) now requires authenticated boot binding. The [public execute path](controller.md#command-admission-and-dispatch-ownership) now uses it; [retained output retrieval](output-storage.md) and [public SSE](api-contract.md#implemented-output-streams) are implemented, the [guest file transport](#file-transfer-messages) is implemented, and public file routes now use it; source cleanup is opt-in; history reclamation remains unfinished. Guest reports do not prove host isolation or allocation release.

## Transport and peer identity

[The shared protobuf](../proto/guest.proto) defines `hudson.guest.v1`. Each connection carries one request and one response, each prefixed by a four-byte big-endian message length. Version 1 supports hello, execute, inspect, cancel, bounded output reads, the additive file messages below, and acknowledged history retirement. Keep field numbers stable; pause/resume messages remain unimplemented.

The guest uses [tokio-vsock](https://docs.rs/tokio-vsock/0.7.2/tokio_vsock/) and accepts only host CID 2. The supervisor connects to an absolute, operator-configured Unix socket created by Firecracker, rejects a symlink/non-socket endpoint, and performs the [Firecracker CONNECT handshake](https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/v1.17.0/docs/vsock.md#host-initiated-connections). The acknowledgement names the assigned host-side port, which need not equal the requested guest port. Customer input must never select this Unix path or the TLS configuration; its parent directory must be controlled by the operator.

Both ends then require TLS 1.3, mutual certificate verification against the configured private CA, an exact SHA-256 peer leaf-certificate pin, and ALPN `hudson-guest/1`. The host additionally verifies the server name `allocation-<allocation UUID>.sandbox.internal`. The guest pins the authorized supervisor's client certificate; a different CA-valid client is insufficient. There is no plaintext mode, CA-only identity bypass, early data, or automatic certificate rotation. [Shared TLS code](../crates/sandbox-protocol/src/guest_wire.rs) uses Rustls's [required client verifier](https://docs.rs/rustls/0.23.45/rustls/server/struct.WebPkiClientVerifier.html).

Provision a guest certificate/key scoped to its allocation, the CA certificate and the supervisor's public certificate pin inside the guest. Keep supervisor private keys, CA signing keys, platform database credentials and Project/Admin tokens outside it. Guest root may steal its own agent key or falsify guest reports; this channel does not make that guest honest. Allocation-scoped issuance and durable boot binding are implemented by [guest bootstrap](guest-bootstrap.md). Certificate rotation and production guest images remain integration work. A reused allocation certificate or unprotected host socket directory is not a supported provisioning shortcut.

## Identity and request flow

Every request carries protocol version, a fresh typed request ID, allocation ID, positive generation and boot ID. The response must echo the request ID and matching context. Missing/unspecified actions, wrong allocation/generation/boot context and malformed frames are rejected. Protobuf unknown fields retain normal protobuf forward-compatibility semantics; explicit protocol versions and known action values still govern dispatch.

A hello request may omit the boot ID to discover the current one. [The host client](../crates/sandbox-supervisor/src/guest.rs) returns that context without changing its existing binding. Commands require a client explicitly bound to the discovered boot. The guardian now [persists that binding](guest-bootstrap.md#binding-before-commands) under allocation ownership before exposing a command client; the real lifecycle driver uses and reconciles it, and discovery alone is not authorization to start a replacement VM or repeat uncertain work.

The [guest listener](../crates/sandbox-guest/src/server.rs) dispatches authenticated calls into the [command runner](guest-runner.md). Execute still commits launch intent before launching. Inspect returns the existing receipt, cancellation persists the request before acknowledgement, and disconnecting does not cancel admitted execution. A sent frame does not prove admission: connection failure can happen before execution, after admission or after a side effect. The client never automatically retries a command.

The initial wire errors are `invalid`, `not_found`, `rejected` and `uncertain`, without arbitrary error strings or command contents. Execute/cancel runner failures conservatively return `uncertain`, including currently undifferentiated admission conflicts/capacity failures; the caller must inspect the original operation and compare its digest. A not-found guest receipt is not proof that another boot or a missing journal never ran it. Public execution preserves that uncertainty rather than treating a guest error as permission to replay.

Host response validation checks correlation, context, known result type, receipt version/state, output counters, digest length, exit-code/signal shape, and cleanup consistency. Execute additionally compares the request digest, deadline and output reservation. Output responses must match operation, stream, offset, next offset and requested length. These checks bound and validate an untrusted report; they do not establish that the reported side effect or cleanup truly happened. Only host-owned observations can release a VM allocation.

## Bounds and shutdown

| Resource | Bound |
| --- | --- |
| Guest connections | 32, including stalled TLS handshakes; excess connections close |
| TLS handshake | Five seconds |
| Frame read/write | Five seconds per complete frame, including a slowly delivered header/body |
| Whole connection | 15 seconds, including host CONNECT/TLS/request/response |
| Encoded protobuf | 1–128 KiB; length checked before allocating its body |
| Output read | 1–32 KiB per call, within the runner's retained reservation |
| Guest request | The stricter argv/environment/request limits in [guest runner](guest-runner.md#bounds-and-retained-state) still apply |

The listener reaps completed connection tasks and holds its semaphore permit for the whole handler. It does not queue unbounded connection work. Dropping a connection handler after its deadline cannot undo already committed execution intent. Blocking guest storage/kernel failures still require an independent host watchdog; these async deadlines cannot substitute for it.

Output requests choose only a typed operation ID, stdout/stderr, offset and length. They cannot supply a filesystem path. The runner opens without following a final symlink, rejects nonregular/oversized files, and bounds reads. The capture workers flush each written chunk before updating in-memory stdout/stderr counters. Output reads expose only the prefix covered by their receipt snapshot, even if later writes have grown the file. Final receipts still require synced captures and confirmed cleanup; intermediate counters are not durable execution evidence. `at_end` describes that captured prefix; `complete` is false while execution is active or its result is unknown. Readers must not confuse a current empty read with final output. Both data and guest counters remain untrusted, and guest output may contain secrets. Public output storage and authorization are separate [API/storage paths](output-storage.md); the supervisor now has a [read-only live-output RPC](supervisor-protocol.md#read-only-live-output). [Public SSE](api-contract.md#implemented-output-streams) now uses the distinct reader service.

On SIGINT/SIGTERM, the guest server stops accepting connections, closes command admission under the runner registry lock and asks the runner to cancel its active command, waiting up to ten seconds for confirmed cleanup. An unconfirmed shutdown returns failure and retains state for recovery. Host-side watchdog enforcement remains required for process death, hung kernel I/O and malicious guest root.

## Development entry point

Inside an operator-prepared Linux guest, use `sandbox-guest serve --help`. Supply the allocation ID/generation, private state directory, dedicated cgroup subtree, CA/certificate/key files and exact supervisor certificate pin. Port 52 is the default. Add `--workspace` with an existing absolute guest directory to enable file calls in this diagnostic service. Omitting it preserves command-only behavior. Normal guest boot enables files at `/workspace`. The existing single-request diagnostic invocation remains available. No TCP listener or unauthenticated testing switch is exposed by the binary.

The production caller is the supervisor library's `GuestClient`, constructed from operator-owned endpoint/TLS configuration and an explicitly bound allocation context. It exposes hello, execute, inspect, cancel, output and file calls. The controller-to-supervisor [gRPC service](supervisor-protocol.md#command-rpcs) now integrates this client under durable host command intent and allocation ownership.

## Evidence and remaining gates

[Portable wire/TLS tests](../crates/sandbox-protocol/tests/guest_wire.rs) cover framing round trips, zero/oversized/truncated/invalid frames, read/write deadlines, wrong CA, wrong exact peer, wrong allocation name, plaintext/stalled TLS and redacted command/output Debug values. [Host client tests](../crates/sandbox-supervisor/tests/guest_client.rs) reject malformed CONNECT replies and forged correlation, identity, receipt and output fields. These run in normal CI without VM privileges.

Ten [opt-in Linux tests](../crates/sandbox-guest/tests/linux_runner.rs) passed, including authenticated host-client calls into real process execution, hello binding, duplicate/conflicting execute, inspect/cancel/output, stale context, disconnect after admission, output symlink/offset rejection and orderly active-command shutdown and concurrent admission fencing. The broader existing process/recovery cases remain covered. The Unix-socket test fixture models Firecracker's routing acknowledgement; it is not a VM isolation test.

The separate [real microVM experiment](evidence/2026-09-21-aarch64-vsock.json) uses actual guest AF_VSOCK and the host Firecracker Unix socket, with ephemeral mutually authenticated TLS identities. It observes exit code 9, guest UID 0, output delivery, timeout, cancellation, exact retry without repeating a side effect and changed-payload rejection. It also holds 32 incomplete TLS handshakes, observes rejection of an additional call and recovery of connection capacity after closing them. The guest server then shuts down and the actual Firecracker child exits; its host cgroup and disposable rootfs are removed.

That experiment uses the [development kernel/Firecracker artifacts](evidence/2026-09-21-aarch64-boot.json) and a one-off BusyBox image fixture. It is not a production image builder, supported x86_64 test or automated release gate. Hostile guest-root impersonation, resource/network attacks, host partitions, real supervisor recovery and public API-to-VM execution remain unverified. The [Phase 1 gates](roadmap.md#scope-discipline-for-phase-1) and [threat-model validation](threat-model.md#required-validation) remain open.

## File transfer messages

Files use the same one-request/one-response framing, mandatory mTLS, request correlation and allocation/generation/boot checks as commands. An unbound client cannot issue file calls. The listener checks that the file service and runner have identical context before dispatch. There is no extra network listener, larger frame limit or customer-selected host path.

| Action | Request and response |
| --- | --- |
| `begin_upload` | Versioned upload descriptor; returns its durable file receipt |
| `write_file` | Original operation ID/digest, contiguous offset and up to 32 KiB; returns matching identity and stored prefix length |
| `inspect_upload` | Original operation ID/digest; returns the retained receipt |
| `commit_upload` | Original operation ID/digest; verifies and publishes the staged file or returns its existing terminal/unknown receipt |
| `abort_upload` | Original operation ID/digest; aborts staging while preserving retry identity |
| `capture_file` | Workspace-relative path; returns a new expiring capture ID, path, size and SHA-256 |
| `read_file` | Capture ID/digest and bounded range; returns bytes with matching cursor/size/end metadata |
| `release_file` | Capture ID/digest; releases that buffer without recreating a missing capture |

[Shared conversions](../crates/sandbox-protocol/src/file_wire.rs) reject missing identities, malformed digests, unknown receipt states and invalid path/size/mode/range values. The [host client](../crates/sandbox-supervisor/src/guest/files.rs) compares file receipts to the complete original upload descriptor and bound boot context; a self-consistent alternate descriptor is still rejected. Upload-byte and downloaded-byte protobuf Debug output is redacted. Caller-side validation is repeated by the guest before file effects.

The [file contract](file-transfer.md) owns workspace resolution, staging/commit/recovery semantics, aggregate bounds and capture lifetime. The server conservatively reports `uncertain` for file-service errors, including conflicts, missing/expired handles and worker deadlines; it does not currently expose a finer error taxonomy. A command-only guest reports `rejected`. An older guest without these additive messages cannot execute them and does not supply proof of file absence. Clients never automatically resubmit file operations or recapture missing handles.

[Portable file wire tests](../crates/sandbox-protocol/tests/file_wire.rs) and [host-client tests](../crates/sandbox-supervisor/tests/guest_files.rs) cover shape, redaction, original descriptor identity and forged capture/progress/range replies. [Linux service tests](../crates/sandbox-guest/src/file_service_tests.rs) exercise actual staged effects, capture expiry/release/restart, shutdown and worker capacity after caller timeout/disconnect. The opt-in guest suite adds authenticated TLS upload/commit/capture, stale allocation/boot rejection, malformed raw paths and a lost commit acknowledgement. The real-host suite includes upload, execution of the uploaded script, chunked download with full SHA-256 verification and allocation teardown. [Recorded aarch64 evidence](evidence/2026-09-21-aarch64-file-transport.json) includes matching source/binary hashes, nine passing host regressions, twelve guest-runner regressions, six unprivileged service tests and the real 98,307-byte round trip. No test cgroups remain. This is development evidence, not supported x86_64 isolation certification.

These are host-to-guest methods. [Controller-to-supervisor upload fencing](file-transfer.md#supervisor-upload-ownership-and-recovery) and the [supervisor download service](file-transfer.md#supervisor-download-service) are implemented; authenticated [public upload/download routes](api-contract.md#implemented-file-uploads) are implemented. History reclamation and remaining file-transfer acceptance stay under [issue #62](https://github.com/hudson-frontier/hudsonbox/issues/62).

## History retirement messages

`RetireHistory` carries a versioned allocation/generation/boot/domain barrier with an inclusive operation-ID prefix. `HistoryRetired` acknowledges durable pruning, not just a persisted admission floor. The guest refuses unresolved covered work and never prunes published upload destinations. The supervisor must first persist its own independent barrier and validate an exact acknowledgement; a guest cannot enlarge the approved prefix. A lost reply is reconciled by repeating retirement, with no automatic transport retry. See the [history contract](history-reclamation.md) for prerequisites, recovery, downgrade behavior and unfinished database integration.
