# Hudson Sandbox

**Run untrusted workloads in isolated environments.**

Hudson Sandbox is a project from **Hudson Labs** building a general-purpose secure runtime for untrusted Linux workloads. Run scripts, applications, build jobs, automation, and services with controlled resources, controlled connectivity, and a reliable lifecycle. AI agents are one possible client.

**Status: early implementation.** PostgreSQL admission, authentication, status handlers, and the [create/destroy controller](docs/controller.md) have tests through an authenticated fake supervisor. The fake runs no customer code. The [HTTPS API and offline project provisioning](docs/api-server.md) now run as a standalone process. The [real Linux supervisor](docs/real-supervisor.md) now has controlled aarch64 evidence for API-created VM readiness, lease renewal and verified destruction. Public execute admission and status now connect to guest commands. Authenticated output reads, SSE streaming and an opt-in [output cleanup worker](docs/output-storage.md#cleanup-worker) are implemented. Command cancellation, [file uploads](docs/api-contract.md#implemented-file-uploads) and [captured downloads](docs/api-contract.md#implemented-file-downloads) are implemented; the [Rust client and project CLI](docs/client-cli.md) and [Python/TypeScript clients](docs/language-clients.md) cover the implemented API. History reclamation, package publication, management UI, and installer remain unfinished. There are no validated isolation or performance guarantees, or a workload quickstart yet.

## What we are building

- **Create and execute:** start a sandbox with explicit resource limits, run commands, and read output.
- **Files and networking:** transfer files safely and enforce connectivity policy.
- **Pause and resume, later:** save memory and disk, release compute, then continue the same sandbox.
- **Manage:** inspect operations, cancel work, and destroy sandboxes with tracked cleanup.
- **Self-host:** operate the service independently, with Project and Admin access through an API and CLI, with a management UI to follow.

```

[Hudson](https://github.com/hudson-infinity/hudson) is the agent harness. Hudson Sandbox supplies the execution environment and works with other applications and harnesses too. Agent workflows and Temporal stay with the caller. Authentication is required everywhere, including local development.

The selected stack is **Rust, Firecracker/Linux KVM, PostgreSQL with SQLx, and S3-compatible object storage**, with HTTP/JSON APIs. Customers get root inside their own sandbox, on a kernel and init that stay ours. We start with one x86_64 Linux compute host; Kubernetes deployment and multiple hosts follow a verified lifecycle.

## Ways to use it

The **HTTP API** is the foundation. **SDKs** provide convenient language functions, the **CLI** serves people, scripts, and agents with shell access, and the **management UI** serves Project users and Admins. Each uses the API; sandbox execution stays on the server.

Output streaming and file transfers are API capabilities. We are not adding MCP for now; [decision 0002](docs/decisions/0002-no-mcp-server-initially.md) records why and what would change it. See [client interfaces](docs/architecture.md#client-interfaces-and-agent-integration) for the agent flow and [client behavior](docs/api-contract.md#sdk-and-cli-behavior) for retries and results. The CLI and SDKs build from source; packages are unpublished and the management UI remains planned.

## Follow the build

Start with the [product goal](docs/goal.md), [documentation guide](docs/README.md), [architecture](docs/architecture.md), and [roadmap](docs/roadmap.md). [Supported configuration](docs/compatibility.md) states what a sandbox is and what it may contain, [networking](docs/networking.md) states what it may reach, [threat model](docs/threat-model.md) states what it must withstand, [alternatives](docs/alternatives.md) explains why we build this rather than adopt an existing product, and [performance](docs/performance.md) states the budgets it has to meet.

Our first usable milestone is **create → execute and transfer files → enforce isolation and limits → destroy**, including failure recovery and a reproducible installation on one supported host. Pause/resume follows. Hudson, Temporal, and Kubernetes are not required.

Before that milestone, a set of [feasibility spikes](docs/roadmap.md#feasibility-spikes-phase-0) runs on real Linux/KVM hardware. They establish what the host boundary costs and actually enforces, and they test the assumption the later pause/resume work rests on — a guest agent that survives a snapshot outside the frozen customer processes and gates their release on resume — which has never been executed.

## Contribute

For prerequisite diagnosis without starting services, run `make doctor` and read
the [local development guide](docs/local-development.md). Native Mac builds and
actual Linux/KVM runtime checks have separate profiles; neither certifies isolation.

Small fixes can start with a pull request. For larger changes, open an issue to agree on scope first. Contributions go through a branch, relevant checks, review, and a maintainer squash merge into `main`.
