//! RFC 9457 `application/problem+json` responses.
//!
//! The standard members carry the human-readable parts. A stable machine
//! code travels in the `code` extension member, because a status alone is too
//! coarse for a client to branch on and prose is not something to parse.
//!
//! Nothing here reveals whether a resource exists in another project.
//! `NotFound` is deliberately the same response for "no such sandbox" and
//! "someone else's sandbox", per `docs/api-contract.md`.
